            <h2>Miscellaneous Comments</h2>
            <p><b>Akhil:</b> I spoke with the captain of Skipjack and the coaches for the UCSD Air Squids and Dragon
                Coaliton.
                They’re both excited about our plans to revive UltiAnalytics, and offered to help promote it if we have
                a
                working release by the start of club season in early June.</p>
            <p>Katherine: Skipjack is a mid level men's club team, so I don't know how much impact that would have. But
                the DCos
                make nationals every year and are always a top 10 women's collegiate team so that would be a huge
                impact. The Air
                Squids are a very popular men's collegiate team with lots of connections, so they could also definetly
                help spread the word </p>
            <p><i>Eric:</i> That kind of exposure would be huge — we should try to make sure we can get a beta ready by
                the start of June
            <details>
                <summary>Team Concerns</summary>
                <p>We’ll need to finalize our core features soon to make that timeline realistic — maybe lock scope by
                    end of April.</p>
